## These functions are built to cache the inverse of a matrix
## that could be high time-cosuming computation

## This function creates a special matrix which is really a list 
## containing the functions needed to cache the matrix 

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## This function calculates the inverse of the special matrix

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
